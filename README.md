# PL Coding January Monthly Challengue

This is the repository with the development I made for the PL Coding community. It's an app to record audios as a journal method. It was divided in 3 different screens:

## Your Echo Journal Screen

A list of all your audios recorded that you can filter by mood or topics.

<table align="center">
  <tr>
		<td><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/610170c7-3831-4774-b0f8-296d9147fa17" width="350" title="hover text"></td>
		<td><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a4003bb-a472-44b6-907d-19e798549509" width="350" title="hover text"></td>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/efa8c88f-8468-436c-8d58-d42764f70c9e" width="350" title="hover text"></td>
	</tr>
</table>

In this screen you can record an audio tapping or holding down the + button.

  	<tr>

	</tr>
</table>

## Record Screen
Here you can add a description for your audio and transcribe it with AI. The result will appear in the description field. Here you can also create topics and set the mood.

	</tr>
</table>


## Settings Screen
This screen allows users to change the default mood that will appear in every record and also the topics.
